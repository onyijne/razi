# Razi

A Lightweight JavaScript Framework

Inspired as a frontend lead at HNG intership 7. After I left the programme, I decided to
continue working on Razi since I was the major contributor and the guys at HNGi7 were
dropping it.

## TODO

- Integrate pug template as it's template engine
- Develop a full page with functioning methods as an example
- Write it's documentation
